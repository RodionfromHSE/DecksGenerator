# DecksGenerator
A collection of scripts for conversion list of english words to complete [en-ru] anki decks with sentences and definitions for each word.

## Cloning the project
**The project has submodules!**

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules $url
```
If you forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` when cloning, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodules.
